# 31536000 in a year

# how many years is 1298 million (1298000000)seconds?
puts 1298000000 / 60 / 60 / 24 / 365
# 41 years, remember that this is using interger division so we are not concerned with seconds down to the month/day/hour/minute/second just seconds in one complete year.

# how many years in 1 billion seconds (roughly 31) (remember this is integer division so no floating point)
puts 1000000000 / 60 / 60 / 24 / 365
